# 🏡 Regression Models on California Housing Dataset

This project demonstrates and compares various regression algorithms using the **California Housing dataset**. Implemented in Python with a Jupyter Notebook, it provides a practical overview of how different models perform on a real-world dataset.

## 📊 Models Implemented

The following regression techniques are explored:

- 📈 **Linear Regression**
- 📉 **Ridge Regression**
- 🧮 **Lasso Regression**
- 🌲 **Decision Tree Regression**
- 🌐 **Random Forest Regression**
- 🤖 **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared using relevant metrics like:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Regression-Models.git
   cd Regression-Models
   ```

2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RegressionTypes.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the notebook cells to explore the models.

## 📈 Dataset

The project uses the **California Housing Dataset**, which includes features such as:

* Median Income
* House Age
* Average Rooms
* Population
* Median House Value (Target)

---

## 📌 Results

Each regression model is evaluated and visualized for performance comparison. Plots and metrics are included in the notebook for interpretation.
